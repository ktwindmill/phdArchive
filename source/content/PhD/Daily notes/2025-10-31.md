Genre's
If writing is my practice so is reading, where is this place?
Exchange, display and collecting people together
Working with other, audience, community of engagement 
What the communication aspect, politics of having media act and behave as a film essay 
Literature review case study, reach out to people in the community
Follow the community - allow the thread to become more involved (anonymity)
Species of practices
Disturbing, remixing, much more fluid
Being locked out of self - digital archeology
Self digital gathering
Why self host, things break, obsolete, broken
Erasure, ossification of online material feeds into the process itself
Sound piece loss 

Think of some interviews, entering into dialogue with particular entities
May effect the research and the film itself
Active case study
Co-writing aspect to the collaborative writing
Is it a set of questions, is it a structured interview, and then how to represent this?
How do people making documentaries research and prepare, what are the building blocks towards making it
Interviewing the keeper of the archives
What are the bars of entry to archives
How things are published, archived, value judgement

Three areas of interest, treat them separate at the moment:
* Dissemination, how things are shared, collectively
* How essays are videos and the genre
* Online writing
