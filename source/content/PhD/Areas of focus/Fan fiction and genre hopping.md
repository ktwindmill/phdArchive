## Writing fan fiction
I'm not someone who has a long history with fanfiction, nor it's more explicit counterpart slash fiction. In fact, it was something I avoided, finding it uncomfortable or frankly uncool. I've never been part of a fandom, having always been a bit magpie-ish in my approach to interests and hobbies. 

* Looking for a type and tone of fiction that I couldn't find in a novel, particularly when looking for something light/fluffy to read. Was asked why I didn't just go read some fan-fiction, and I replied I didn't know what subject to look at. Was advised it doesn't matter, just go for the popular ones. 
* Interested in the tagging and definitions, the interlinking inspirations, the interpretations of sections.
* Space for queer/trans/disabled writers
* Inexorably linked to pornography, despite a reasonable amount of PG content on sites like Ao3.

I still find it embarrassing - I was explaining my interest to a colleague in a public place and lowered my voice, why?
