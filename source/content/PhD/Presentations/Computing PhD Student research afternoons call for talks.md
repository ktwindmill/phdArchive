This practice led research project aims to explore and develop methodologies around computational film making, experimental film and artist essay. I am engaging with methodologies including film collage, speculative fiction and writing practices, and exploring how these practices are mediated through the use of technology broadly, and in what affordances are enabled through use of computational methods like generatively coauthored text and film footage, and programmatic video editing. I am currently in the early stages of research, focussing more on three areas: genre and how it is utilised, disseminating and activating text collectively, and technologically mediated artist essay.

Notes from the presentation

* Raised a point about my work feeling like its in opposition to big tech data sets (for instance stuff being trained on corpuses of novels). Is this true
* Need to historically contextualise it, in relation to other types of work which borrow (i.e. Pop art reappropriated mass media)
* Whats the different between other borrowing traditions i.e. sampling, remixing
