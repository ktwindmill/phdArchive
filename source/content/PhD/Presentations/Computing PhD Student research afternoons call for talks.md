This practice led research project aims to explore and develop methodologies around computational film making, experimental film and artist essay. I am engaging with methodologies including film collage, speculative fiction and writing practices, and exploring how these practices are mediated through the use of technology broadly, and in what affordances are enabled through use of computational methods like generatively coauthored text and film footage, and programmatic video editing. I am currently in the early stages of research, focussing more on three areas: genre and how it is utilised, disseminating and activating text collectively, and technologically mediated artist essay.
