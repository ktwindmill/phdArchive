I intended to write a diary yesterday, but left it until today because of being lasy. I am trying not to be too hard on myself that I ignored a goal almost immediately. It's fine. It's not like I didn't have a lot on otherwise. 

Today I will work on my phd, then I'll spend an hour max making notes for the two minutes I have to talk tomorrow. That's easy.

Then Monday I'll finish my talk for Tuesday (lol). I might have to also do some of that over the weekend if I'm honest but that's not too bad. This is me trying not to panic. I am excited though, excited to get started making things. I need to do some exercise.
