What am I looking for?
Foraging

Scaffolding a research methodology 
Figure out annotation, and annotation of the research 
Themes and sections 
Mapping out structures, allowing time for deep reading
Where do I want the research to be? Websites, archival or repository, where are chunks of writing going to live
Weaving practice into the methodology (mixed method, autoethnographic) different registers of academic and none academic writing


To do:
- [ ] Research method training
- [ ] Mapping the practice, relevant to what? 
- [ ] Look through all my notes and see what there is - anything useful 
- [ ] Diary practice, reflective practice
- [ ] Don't limit practice to the phd as limiting
- [ ] Summary of where we are at with different components
- [ ] Pin down some empty boxes
- [ ] It's the most important thing (wall myself up, safeguard the time)
- [ ] Watch some films!
- [ ] What am I doing, how do I integrate all of these things
- [ ] Porosity with In-grid
- [ ] Where does that practice reside, literature review of practice
- [ ] Repositories and structures
