Weaving practice into the methodology (mixed method, autoethnographic) different registers of academic and none academic writing


To do:

- [ ] Summary of where we are at with different components
- [ ] Pin down some empty boxes

- [ ] Porosity with In-grid
- [ ] Where does that practice reside, literature review of practice
