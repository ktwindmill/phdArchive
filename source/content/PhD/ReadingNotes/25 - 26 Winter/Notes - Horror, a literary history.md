#aside Reading the first chapter (intro) to this collection of essays when in page 8 the author says of horror 'Heavily intertextual and referential, often intentionally formulaic, horror texts can often be easily identified by the enticing or daring messages that often address the potential reader from the lurid covers of books or from film posters.' It reminded me of the tv series American Horror Story, which - season after season - crams in to its plots as many horror tropes as possible. Self referentially and intentionally over egging the pudding while being at times genuiley disquieting. All that and impossible camp.
