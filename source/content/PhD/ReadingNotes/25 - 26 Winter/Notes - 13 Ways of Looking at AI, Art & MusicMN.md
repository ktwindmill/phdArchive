****The Ted Lasso fan shipping Ted-Trent not only wants characters Ted Lasso and Trent Crimm to get it on, they are also convinced that the writers have been leaving clues as to Ted & Trent’s feelings in every scene, uniquely for them to find, and they have the screenshots on their Tumblr to prove it.**

- I'm not sure that is the case - used for affect here, but feels reductive i.e. Fan fiction writers obsessive/crazy.
- Does make the point about shipping real people becoming obsessive, and there is a side to internet fan culture, and fan culture in general which is unhealthy, but from what I gather, rare - but I'm making assumptions.

 **I see the possibility for new models of collaboration, new models of compensation and community-building, new models of exploitation and exclusion. And I also see a future with a million Larry Stylinsons.**

* I feel less conflicted about this, but then, am I one who emulates? Am I being to optimistic about the collaborative potential of this, or do I just not mind about my IP all that much. Would I feel differently if I was at another stage of my career? Is it because I would use the Draw Like X how to guides in comics? I do find shipping real people odd, but am interested in reappropriating, and remixing other properties. Is the issue who does it or the scale? 
* Machinima animations (i.e. red vs blue), what was the original copywrite issues there
* Many fan fic and drawing sites are anti ai content - does copying matter less if its hand drawn?
* Think about Nina's research into copywriting dancing

**For artists like myself and many others, “A.I.” represents new, un-dreamt of forms of art, genres which noone has ever heard, joyous and life-affirming ways of making art and music which are beyond our comprehension, just over the horizon of the vibe shift. We are bullish on “A.I.”**

**AI isn’t coming for your jobs. Humans are. “A.I.” is a way to avoid talking about that.**

4. **AI is Conceptual Art**
