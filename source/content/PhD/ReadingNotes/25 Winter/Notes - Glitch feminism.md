## Introduction

>  Yet online I could be whatever I wanted. And so my twelve-year-old self became sixteen, became twenty, became seventy. I aged. I died. Through this storytelling and shapeshifting, I was resurrected. I claimed my range.

Similar to genre hopping? Creating versions of self.

>  In chatrooms I donned different corpo-realities while the rainbow wheel of death buffered in the ecstatic, dawdling jam of AOL dial-up.

Stylistically it oscillated between tones - sensual, niche, situated (web speak, academic language, poetry)

#aside
An aside - algospeak as a way of subverting shadow banning leaking into terrestrial conversation? By subverting censorship, finding another kind of censorship (although it's not even that censored, we all know what unalive/pewpew/grape/sa refers to).

Trippy and trip wired (spooky and unreal, dangerous and psychedelic)

 #aside There's something about the refusal to perform gender through pronouns that is tickling another area of my brain but I'm not sure what I mean yet. This is mentioned as a form of refusal of gender normativety, and a 'body that refuses to perform the score'. I'm thinking of writers who identify as female for instance, but use initials to obscure gender, this is not always a refusal but potentially a entrenching of those norms? I used G George as a pseudonym to appear as more than one person, but also it was assumed I was a man, regardless that George as a surname doesn't suggest a gender. That was partly conscious. This also occurs in screen names which may or maynot reflect particular characteristics.

> Thus, the glitch creates a fissure within which new possibilities of being and becoming manifest. This failure to function within the confines of a society that fails us is a pointed and necessary refusal. Glitch feminism dissents, pushes back against capitalism.

Being indefinable, unclassifiable. I find this difficult, because I like topologies in the same way I like organising materials, and objects in containers. I know however there is a freedom in messiness. I just never know where I've put anything.

> Though the artifice of a simple digital Shangri-La— a world online where we could all finally be “freed” from the mores of gender as dreamt of by early cyberfeminists—is now punctured, the Internet still remains a vessel through which a “becoming” can realize itself. The glitch is a passage through which the body traverses toward liberation, a tear in the fabric of the digital.

I feel like I want to be this but I'm not. I consume a lot online, but I don't act a lot online. I'm very careful about commenting, posting in some ways, and I've never been part of an online community. Maybe that's fine. Actually, maybe I am doing this, but it's more about observing communities that reflect my gender expression, sexuality and interests, even if I'm not actively contributing content as in posts. If I were, would I want it to be the same version of me that works in academia. Do I want those things to be cohesive - it's always made me uncomfortable when it is in some ways. I like being known but hate being perceived. (I need to get over myself).

Jane’s naming and claiming of “multiple selves” pushes back against a flattened reading of historically othered bodies—intersectional bodies who have traveled restlessly, gloriously, through narrow spaces. These are the selves that, as writer and activist Audre Lorde wrote in her 1978 poem “A Litany for Survival,” “live at the shoreline” and “were never meant to survive.

Avatar v alter-ego. What is it to be more than one thing, one version of working - can I do this under one name? In this came as an alter ego then an extension of self. 

I keep knocking up against the idea of continually thinking of self here - who gives a shit about me etc. Maybe the thing is not to be thinking of how this frames me and my practice, but how it can be a method of magpieing bits of selves? I am white, cis female, queer and disabled (but invisibly disabled (and I personally feel weird about claiming that being able bodied despite having the legal status), queer in a straight relationship). I feel like genre swapping/hopping could be considered glitching/dragging but is this appropriate (probably, who says it's not)?

> The oblique romance of Internet-as-utopia, against this backdrop reality, should not be dismissed as naïve. Imbuing digital material with fantasy today is not a retro act of mythologizing; it continues as a survival mechanism.

I agree and I don't. I'm maybe more sceptical but then again, I'm continually living as other people (borrowing tropes) rather than another version of myself. Is that the difference between genre hopping and alter-egoing?
